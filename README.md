Paper: the link will be available soon.

The simulation section presents three experiments of simulated data and we simulate this data with three different techniques.

## Coxed Library

## Simsurv Library

## Python Experiments

* numfeatures_generate_data: the script used to generate the data of the decreasing number of features experiment.
* numsamples_generate_data: the script used to generate the data of the increasing number of samples.
* percensorship_generate_data: the script used to generate the data of the increasing percentage of censorship.
