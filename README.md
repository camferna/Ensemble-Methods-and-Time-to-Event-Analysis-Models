Paper: the link will be available soon.

The simulation section presents three experiments of simulated data and we simulate this data with three different techniques.

We used coxed library and simsurv library implemented in R. 

## Coxed Library

* coxed_numfeatures: the script used to generate the data of the decreasing number of features experiment.
* coxed_numsamples: the script used to generate the data of the increasing number of samples experiment.
* coxed_percensorship: the script used to generate the data of the increasing percentage of censorship experiment.

## Simsurv Library

* simsurv_numfeatures: the script used to generate the data of the decreasing number of features experiment.
* simsurv_numsamples: the script used to generate the data of the increasing number of samples experiment.
* simsurv_percensorship: the script used to generate the data of the increasing percentage of censorship experiment.

## Python Experiments

* numfeatures_generate_data: the script used to generate the data of the decreasing number of features experiment.
* numsamples_generate_data: the script used to generate the data of the increasing number of samples experiment.
* percensorship_generate_data: the script used to generate the data of the increasing percentage of censorship experiment.
